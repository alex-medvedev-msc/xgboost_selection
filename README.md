# Code for paper "Human genotype-to-phenotype predictions: boosting accuracy with nonlinear models"

[medrxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.30.21259753v1.full)

## Short Description

Scripts for selecting snps with XGBoost, train LightGBM, CatBoost and XGBoost prediction models. Notebooks for experiments on simulated phenotypes and for analysis. 

All computations were performed on Zhores cluster which uses slurm cluster management system. To repeat these experiments on another slurm cluster one can use .sh scripts in src folder. However, one can launch python scripts on any machine directly.
XGBoost selection and all prediction models require up to 160GB RAM and preferably a GPU with 16GB VRAM. 

## Data Preparation

## XGBoost Selection



## Gradient Boosting Prediction Models

## SNPNet Prediction Models

## Plots and Analysis
